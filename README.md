Horsion Jump Site.  Roy Levine.

This replaces earlier submission that failed the repository standards.

All sourced images in the html have been assigned alt descriptions.

cleaned up a broken h ref link in header.

cleaned semantic elements in html.

re-ordered stylesheet contents to make them flow with the html.

added alt description on url sourced in the CSS.  Not sure whether this worked.

attempted to move background (hero) image from CSS to html, for accessability purposes. Caused problems that I should have been able to fix but could not - so it remained unchanged.
