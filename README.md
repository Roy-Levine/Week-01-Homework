Horsion Jump Site.  Roy Levine.

This replaces earlier submission that failed the repository standards.

All sourced images in the html have been assigned alt descriptions.

cleaned up a broken h ref link in header.

cleaned semantic elements in html.

re-ordered stylesheet contents to make them flow with the html.

added alt description on url sourced in the CSS.  Not sure whether this worked.

attempted to move background (hero) image from CSS to html, for accessability purposes. Caused problems that I should have been able to fix but could not - so it remained unchanged.

Intermittent commits were flailing exercises in getting the site to load right on the url and are not worth mentioning.

on seventh commit, I pulled the background image out of the CSS for two reason.  Firstly, I could not put an alt label on the image in CSS.  Secondly, the image's native dimensions may have effected its display in the URL via github.  (see lines 13 -15).  We shall see.  (Afternote, I failed to fix the screen display issue in the url, but did put an accessible descriptor in the only image not prevoiusly addressed.  Throwin in the towel! 

one more attempt after night's sleep. Adjusted margins in css and worked to make html more semantic by swapping divs for better identifiers
